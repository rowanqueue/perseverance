This sample may contain signs of ancient microbial life. This is one of the key things Perseverance is looking for. That rock could be full of tiny Martian life forms!
This sample Perseverance picked up is probably cooler than other rocks—temperature-wise, that is! The outer layers of rock are exposed to high heat and radiation, which kills organic material. That's why Perseverance takes samples from rock cores.
It's important to test instruments before sending them into space! Scientists tested Perseverance's sample-collection technology in a dry, dusty part of Australia.
Scientists can learn a lot from small samples. Each sample Perseverance collects is only half an inch wide and 2.4 inches long. 
Perseverance has to approach each sample slowly. That's because everything it does is slow - at top speeds, the rover can only move at .1 mile per hour.
Perseverance is not the first rover to teach us about potential life on Mars. In 2018, the Curiosity rover discovered organic molecules in three-billion-year-old rocks. That means the rocks are 2.75 billion years older than the first dinosaurs!
To prevent contamination, or accidentally getting compounds from Earth on the sample, Perseverance is loaded with "witness tubes." The tubes "witness" the environment Perseverance takes samples from. In the future, scientists can compare the samples and witness tubes to see if any Earth contaminants ended up in sample tubes.
In addition to samples that may contain signs of ancient life, Perseverance may also take samples of volcanic rock. These will tell scientists how the landscape of Mars changed over time.
