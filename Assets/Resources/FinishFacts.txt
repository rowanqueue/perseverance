This sample may contain signs of ancient microbial life, which is one of the key things Perseverance is looking for. That rock could be full of tiny Martians!
The sample Perseverance picked up is cooler than other rocks - temperature-wise, that is! The hotter a rock has been over time, the less likely it is that the rock contains organic material.
It's important to test instruments before sending them into space! Scientists tried out Perseverance's sample-collection tech in a dry, dusty part of Australia.
