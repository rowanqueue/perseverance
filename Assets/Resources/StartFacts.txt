Mars is called the "Red Planet" because its surface is full of rust-colored iron oxide.
The Perseverance rover has 23 cameras and two microphones. It can take selfies if directed!
The atmosphere on Mars is 96% carbon dioxide and only 0.174% oxygen. Don't try breathing that!
On ancient Mars, we think water was abundant on the surface and it left its mark in the form of dried-out river deltas. The Jezero Crater is the site of one of those ancient deltas.
Perseverance may look small in pictures, but it's the size of a car and weighs 2,260 pounds!
Perseverance is carrying a helicopter to Mars! Four-pound Ingenuity will detach from Perseverance after landing in order to take the first powered flight on the Red Planet.
Perseverance launched on July 30th, 2020. It will travel for seven months before landing on Mars in February of 2021. Talk about a long road trip!
Perseverance's mission will last at least one Mars year, or 687 Earth days. Mars has longer years than we do because it's farther away from the Sun.
Perseverance is powered by a plutonium generator, which gives off energy in the form of heat. The generator can last up to 14 years!
Perseverance's computer has two gigabytes of flash memory. That's nothing next to a smartphone, but it's eight times the memory of the last rovers.
