Congratulations, scientist! You've been selected to create the geological sample program for NASA's new Mars rover, Perseverance.
Welcome to mission control at the Johnson Space Center. Here, you'll beam instructions from Earth to Mars.
One of Perseverance's top jobs is taking geological samples. The rover has drills and lasers - think of them like hands! - that it can use to pick up objects.
Once Perseverance takes those samples, it stores them in caches. On future missions, we'll bring the samples back and analyze them here.
It's your job to tell Perseverance where to go each day. Think you can handle that?
Check out this map of the Jezero Crater. See that robot? That's the rover!
Let's experiment. Press the up, down, turn right, and turn left buttons in any order you want. Then press 'send.'
Good work!
Now take a look at the sample icon. Move forward, then use the pickup button to collect the sample.
Place the sample on the cache.
