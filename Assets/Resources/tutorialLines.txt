Congratulations, scientist! You've been selected to program NASA's new Mars rover, Perseverance.
Welcome to mission control at the Johnson Space Center. Here, you'll beam instructions from Earth to Mars.
On average, the two planets are almost 140,000,000 miles apart!
That's why it takes 20 minutes for instructions to reach the rover from mission control.
